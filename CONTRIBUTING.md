# How to contribute

## Development guide

This project is using NPM to use packages and run actions. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

Presentations are made from Markdown files located in `slides` folder, with [Slidev](https://sli.dev/) ([code](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev), [docs](https://sli.dev/guide/why.html)).

To start a specific slide show:

- run the website with `npm run dev slides/demo.md`
- edit `slides/demo.md` and see the changes applied automatically on [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030)

ðŸ’¡ Look at the presenter options while presenting (switch dark mode switch for example)
